# ShieldAI-Cloud-Native-Framework-for-Preventing-Prompt-Injection-AI-Phishing
“ShieldAI” is a cloud-native AI security framework designed to act as a protective shield for Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI-powered cloud applications. The name reflects its core purpose:  Shield → providing multi-layer protection against cyber threats.  AI → securing Artificial Intelligence systems from modern attack vectors. 



## 🔹 Overview  
ShieldAI is a **cloud-native AI security framework** that protects Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI-powered applications deployed on the cloud.  
It acts as a **protective shield** against two of the most critical threats in modern AI systems:  
- **Prompt Injection Attacks** – where malicious queries override system instructions.  
- **AI-Driven Phishing** – where attackers use AI to generate realistic phishing emails, chats, or voice content.
